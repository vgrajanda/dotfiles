# Dotfiles

Here I will post my dotfiles and changes I make to them. I'm not a pro about tilling window managers but I'm trying to learn new stuff every day about them and also learn as much as I can about Linux. 

## Reminders

- If you want rounded corners and animations you need this picom: https://github.com/jonaburg/picom
- A very cool lightdm theme: https://github.com/Litarvan/lightdm-webkit-theme-litarvan
- Keep it simple and learn how this stuff work ;)

## Other WM that I don't know how to use

- [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/) - Lua window manager
- [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) - I need to lose fear about using suckless tools
- [herbstluftwm](https://herbstluftwm.org/) - Very cool WM, I need to spend more time using it
